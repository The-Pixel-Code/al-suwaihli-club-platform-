## 📦 How to Use Downloaded Models

### Step 1: Download Models
1. Download models in `.glb` or `.gltf` format (best for web)
2. If only `.obj` or `.fbx` available, convert using:
   - Online converter: https://products.aspose.app/3d/conversion
   - Or use Blender (free) to convert

### Step 2: Optimize Models for Web
```bash
# Install gltf-pipeline globally
npm install -g gltf-pipeline

# Compress your model
gltf-pipeline -i input.glb -o output.glb --draco.compressionLevel=10
```

### Step 3: Add Models to Your Project
1. Create folder: `public/models/`
2. Place your `.glb` files:
   ```
   public/
   └── models/
       ├── football.glb
       ├── basketball.glb
       ├── table-tennis.glb
       └── chess-knight.glb
   ```

### Step 4: Update Component
Update the `sports-showcase-gltf.tsx` file with your model paths:

```typescript
const models = [
  { 
    name: 'Football', 
    url: '/models/football.glb',  // Your actual model
    scale: 2,  // Adjust based on model size
  },
  // ... other models
];
```

## 🚀 Quick Start with Online Models

For immediate testing, you can use these CDN-hosted models:

```typescript
const models = [
  { 
    name: 'Football', 
    url: 'https://vazxmixjsiawhamofees.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/models/soccer-ball/model.gltf',
  },
  { 
    name: 'Basketball', 
    url: 'https://vazxmixjsiawhamofees.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/models/basketball/model.gltf',
  },
  // Add more from Three.js examples
];
```

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

1. **File Size**: Keep models under 1MB for fast loading
2. **Polygon Count**: Aim for < 10,000 polygons per model
3. **Textures**: Use compressed textures (`.jpg` or `.webp`)
4. **Format**: Always use `.glb` (binary) over `.gltf` (JSON) for smaller files
5. **Testing**: Test on mobile devices for performance

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Model Not Loading
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify file path is correct
- Ensure model is in `.glb` or `.gltf` format

### Model Too Large
- Use Blender's Decimate modifier
- Reduce texture resolution
- Use draco compression

### Model Looks Wrong
- Check scale in component
- Adjust lighting in scene
- Verify model orientation
